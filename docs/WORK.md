# Active work and handoff

## Delivered

The author authorized autonomous implementation, public repository creation/push and technical release preparation. Checkpoint revisions, ten-item history, restore, recoverable drafts, conflict handling, deletion/replay safeguards, extension cleanup outbox and improved registry-composed screens are implemented.

Public source: https://github.com/kirmada1509/reentry. Preview assets: https://github.com/kirmada1509/reentry/releases/tag/v0.1.0. The release includes a 108-second actual-NVIDIA MP4, SRT/VTT captions and screenshots. Source instructions are explicitly fictional. README and docs/RELEASE.md explain reproducible setup and limits.

## Verification

- `pnpm check`: 86 unit/integration tests across thirteen files plus formatting/lint/web+extension types/UI provenance/focused secrets/context guards.
- Final complete production web/extension suite: 42 deterministic cases passed together, with two explicit live/recording skips.
- Final actual-NVIDIA demo/live-context accessibility: three passed, one synthetic-only skip. Final deterministic accessibility subset: three passed. Tests include browser restart, worker suspension, failed writes, stale results, edit conflicts, history/restore/deletion, axe, focus, long text, 320px reflow and simulated 200% text.
- Fresh clone bootstrap of `3cbf03f` passed without copied private context or credentials. Focused publication audit covers history, tracked files and built browser assets.
- Fresh six-scenario NVIDIA evaluation retained an initial decrease timeout; an isolated explicit repeat passed. No application retry/fallback was added. Evidence/limitations: docs/TEST_RESULTS.md and docs/evidence/.
- The hosted CI restriction was resolved October 22. Rerun 39701097413 passed project checks and 41 browser cases, but one accessibility case required the macOS extension font name on Linux. A retry-only fix confirmed that Chromium consistently supplies an OS-specific body font there. Font assertions now wait for the configured system font on the root and accept the browser’s sans-serif body stack, preserving the intended Geist/system sans requirements. Local `pnpm check` and all three production accessibility journeys passed after the fix. Hosted verification of the fix is pending. Repository/license and public video/caption downloads were verified anonymously; final production smoke passed after restoring the default-origin extension build and managed app. The app uses http://127.0.0.1:3000 with NVIDIA enabled and hosted processing agreement required.

## Decisions

Keep the local Chrome/web product, NVIDIA default with explicit agreement, optional Ollama and provider-independent harness. Other provider keys are unused. Credentials, learner profile and raw runtime profiles remain ignored. Official registry font wiring fixes the starter's serif fallback; finite transition settling makes axe scans deterministic without suppressing contrast rules.

## Remaining human gates

The Mac was locked and could not be automatically unlocked. Native Chrome/VoiceOver and actual browser text/zoom acceptance remain unperformed. A public YouTube/Vimeo upload for AI Basics is still needed. Retrospective Learn documents/app map and technical submission drafts are prepared; genuine learner reviews/reflections, personal answers, eligibility/registration attestations and final submissions are not fabricated. No contest was submitted.

Rebuild/reload the extension in Chrome after updates while retaining the same ID/origin/profile. Browser storage is not an encrypted vault or backup. Clearing site data removes saved work.
